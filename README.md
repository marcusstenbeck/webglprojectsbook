# WebGL Projects

This book is a collection of WebGL projects. I really enjoy how the book "Nature of Code" teaches programming by showing the fantastic and expressive things that can be done with it. Many WebGL learning resources that I've encountered are great, but the kind of leave you hanging. I hope to create a more fun way of learning the core concepts of raw WebGL and the various rendering techniques that exist by baking them into projects.

If you found this useful, please let me know to I keep working on it. All suggestions are welcome, and please put them in the issue tracker for this project.
